This is a project about an analysis of certain variables concerned with Indian start-ups for a 4-year period from 2018 to 2021.
My part of the whole process is to ensure that the datasets are cleaned and later merged and gleamed.
So far, i've been able to clean all the datasets, get them concatenated into one dataframe, and had irrelevant columns dropped. I added some visualizations in order to help me understand the distribution of the dataframe variables.
